Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",">> parameter is A variable listed in a function's definition.\n","Argument is The actual value passed to a function when calling it.\n","\n","Q3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",">> We have multiple ways to defined the function such as basic function,args,kwars,map,lambda,filter,reduce function\n","\n","4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",">> The return statement in a Python function is used to send back a value to the caller and terminate the function.\n","\n","5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",">> An iterator is an object that remembers its position while iterating.\n","It implements __iter__() and __next__().\n","\n",">> Iterable is Collection of elements (like list, tuple).\n","Iterator is Object that produces elements one at a time using next().\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",">> A generator is a special type of iterator that allows you to iterate over data without storing it in memory.\n","\n","7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",">> Generators offer several benefits over regular functions, especially when working with large datasets or streaming data.\n","Best for large datasets & streaming data (low memory usage).\n","\n","a.  Faster execution (does not precompute values).\n","b.  Great for infinite sequences (no memory overflow).\n","c.  Simplifies iteration & retains state.\n","d. Supports chaining & pipelining (efficient data processing).\n","\n","8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",">> A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function (i.e., a function without a name) that is defined using the lambda keyword.\n","\n","9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",">> The map() function in Python is used to apply a function to every item in an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) and return a new iterable (map object).\n","\n","10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n","\n",">> a. map()\tApplies a function to each element of an iterable and returns a new iterable.\n","\n",">> a. filter()\tSelects elements from an iterable based on a condition (returns only True values).\n","\n",">> c. reduce()\tAggregates the iterable into a single value using a function.\n","\n","\n","11.
